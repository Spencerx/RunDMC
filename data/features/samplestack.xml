<h1>Samplestack</h1>

<p>Samplestack is a comprehensive sample application that is the best way to learn how to build a MarkLogic application effectively. It is intended as a tool for exploration, reference, and extension. Start by visiting the <a href="https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-samplestack">GitHub site</a> where Samplestack is being developed publicly as an open-source project under the Apache 2.0 license. <a href="https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-samplestack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contribute pull requests</a>, provide feedback and participate in the conversation through <a href="https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-samplestack/issues">issue reports</a> in the GitHub repository. You can also track features and bug fixes that are on our roadmap.</p>

<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">
  <a class="btn btn-default btn-sm" href="https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-samplestack">Samplestack on GitHub ›</a></p>

<p>We built each application feature to demonstrate powerful and unique MarkLogic concepts. Even though it's a sample application, Samplestack has enterprise-grade features such as <a href="//docs.marklogic.com/guide/app-dev/transactions?hq=transaction#chapter">transactional multi-document, multi-statement commits</a> and <a href="//docs.marklogic.com/guide/security/role?hq=role-based%20security#chapter">role-based security</a>.</p>

<p>The Java and Node.js versions of Samplestack are available now, with the following features implemented from database server to browser. Follow along on GitHub as active development continues.</p>

<h3>Deeper Dive</h3>
<p>Focus on the middleware and its use of MarkLogic's client APIs:</p>
<ul>
    <li>View the database configurations and the application code to see how Java/Spring middle tier consumes the data services provided by the MarkLogic database via the <a href="/features/java-client-api">Java API</a>.</li>
    <li>Browse the Node.js middle tier to get a feel for how the <a href="/features/node-client-api">Node.js API</a> provides access to MarkLogic's built-in search and security features.</li>
  </ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">In order to make Samplestack relevant to your development environment, we’ve also included components for the last mile of application development for a richer, hands-on experience:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li>Build: Gradle is used for deployment and configuration automation of the Java middle tier. Gulp is the tool used to automate building the browser-side components as well as the Node.js middle tier.</li>
    <li>Testing: The project includes unit tests and integration tests that automate orchestration of set-up and tear-down.
    <ul>
	<li>JUnit is the testing framework for the Java middle tier.</li>
	<li>The Angular.js browser tests are run by <a class="external-link" href="http://nodejs.org/" rel="nofollow">Node.js</a>. Other technologies used for testing include mocha, chai, and sinon.</li>
      </ul>
